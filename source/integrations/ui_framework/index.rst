Emarsys UI Framework
====================

An integration's design should match the design of the Emarsys application, so users will have a seamless
integration experience. The Emarsys UI Framework used by our products is also available for our integrations.

In order to use the framework, you have to include both CSS and JavaScript into your page. The framework's `CSS
file <https://redirector.eservice.emarsys.net/ui/latest/css/app.css>`_ should be linked in the header, the `JavaScript
file <https://redirector.eservice.emarsys.net/ui/latest/js/app.js>`_ should be just before the closing body tag:

For more information about the framework and the available components, please visit our
`Styleguide <https://redirector.eservice.emarsys.net/ui/latest/styleguide/index.html>`_.
