Registering your Service with Automation Center
===============================================

At this point, we do not have a UI for registering services, so this will need to be taken care of manually by the Automation
Center team. Please send the following information to your contact person:

* Icons - Two copies:

  * A 20x20 pixel icon to use on the toolbar
  * A 50x50 pixel icon to use in the editor

* The name of your service that you want to display next to the icon
* A list of which customers should have access to the API node (all customers, or customers with a given feature)
* A trigger endpoint URL, i.e. the URL that needs to be called when the program wants to trigger your service
* A label that will appear below the nodes in the Automation Center (if your service does not use resources)
* A resource options endpoint URL (if your service uses the resource options endpoint)
* A label that will appear below the nodes and will be followed by the resource name (if your service uses the resource options endpoint).
* The custom node dialogue endpoint URL (if your service uses the custom node dialogue endpoint)

.. note::

   If the new node is going to be available for a large number of customers, the icons should be created by
   our graphic designer.

Using the provided information, the Automation Center team will add your service and notify you as soon as it is
available. During the development process, the new node will only be available to you so that you can test before it is released.
