Containers
==========

We provide an integration point where your service can be integrated with the Emarsys application as a container
on a page. For example, a dashboard can display a chart created by your service, or on an existing page we display
a new tab that loads an iframe of your integration. The design of the container should ideally match the Emarsys
design, so it will look like it is part of our application.

The container should load a Single Page Application, it is not possible to create a cookie based session inside
the iframe as some browsers like Safari and Internet Explorer blocks setting cookies in "third-party" iframes.

The container's URL will be "presigned" with Escher. You can authenticate with these requests with the following
Escher library configuration:

* *Credential Scope* is specific to the service the request is going to. In this case it will be your credential
  scope, for example "**eu/yourservice/ems_request**".
* *Algo Prefix* and *Vendor Key* are both set to "**EMS**"
* *Date Header Key* is set to "**X-Ems-Date**"
* *Authentication Header Key* is set to "**X-Ems-Auth**"
