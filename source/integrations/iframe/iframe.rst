Single Sign-on
==============

We provide an integration point where your service can be integrated with the Emarsys application as a page.
This involves adding a new menu entry and loading your page content within an iframe. The design of your page
should ideally match the Emarsys design, so it will look like it is part of our application.

Some browsers like Safari and Internet Explorer blocks setting cookies in "third-party" iframes. In our case,
it would make cookie based session handling impossible, and session handling generally hard. The solution is
that on loading the integration's Emarsys page, our application will redirect the browser to the integration's
login URL, allowing it to create the session cookie. It will send customer information, and a redirect URL
points to the Emarsys application, where the integration have to redirect back the browser. On that page we
are going to load the iframe of the integration, and display it to the customer.
