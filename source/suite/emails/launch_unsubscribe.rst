Unsubscribing a Contact from an Email Campaign
==============================================

Marks a contact as unsubscribed for an email campaign launch so it will be counted in the campaign statistics. It affects
the response summary (:doc:`launch_response_summary`) and :doc:`../../suite/exports/export_responses`, and
makes segmentation based on unsubscribtion possible.

It **does not change** the opt-in status of the contact, this must be done with an additional API request
(:doc:`../../suite/contacts/contact_update`) if necessary.

.. note:: It is useful if you aim at:

          * sending email campaigns with unsubscribe links which target your own website
          * unsubscribing the user by updating specific fields in his user profile (e.g. a newsletter flag)
          * counting the unsubscription for the statistics of the specific campaign, not from all campaigns

In your campaign body, create a new link which points to the unsubscription page of your
website. You can use $cid$, $llid$ and $uid$. $cid$ will be replaced with the email ID, $llid$ with the
launch list ID and $uid$ with the randomly generated contact ID. Example:
`http://yourwebsite.com/unsubscribe.html?email_id=$cid$&launchlist_id=$llid$contact_id=$uid$`

For the list of possible campaign related placeholders, see :doc:`../appendices/placeholders`.
