Unsubscribing a Contact from an Email Campaign
==============================================

Flags contacts as unsubscribed for an email campaign launch so they will be included in the campaign statistics. It affects
the response summary (:doc:`launch_response_summary`) and :doc:`../../suite/exports/export_responses`, as well as making
segmentation based on unsubscription possible.

Unsubscribing the contact from an email campaign **does not change** the opt-in status of the contact. Opt-in changes must be performed using an additional API request
(:doc:`../../suite/contacts/contact_update`) if necessary.

.. note:: This endpoint is useful if you intend to:

          * send email campaigns with unsubscribe links which target your own website
          * unsubscribe contacts by updating specific fields in their user profile (e.g. a newsletter flag)
          * count the unsubscription statistics of a specific campaign (not from all campaigns)

In your campaign body, create a new link which points to the unsubscription page of your
website. You can include placeholders $cid$, $llid$ and $uid$ to get the required parameters for calling this API endpoint.

         * $cid$ will be replaced with the email ID
         * $llid$ with the launch list ID
         * $uid$ with the randomly generated contact ID

An example link is: `http://yourwebsite.com/unsubscribe.html?email_id=$cid$&launchlist_id=$llid$`

For a complete list of campaign related placeholders, see :doc:`../appendices/placeholders`.
