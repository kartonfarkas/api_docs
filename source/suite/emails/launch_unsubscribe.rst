Unsubscribing a Contact from an Email Campaign
==============================================

Flags a contact as unsubscribed for an email campaign launch so they will included in the campaign statistics. It affects
the response summary (:doc:`launch_response_summary`) and :doc:`../../suite/exports/export_responses`, as well as making
segmentation based on unsubscription possible.

Unsubscribing the contact from an email campaign **does not change** the opt-in status of the contact. Opt-in changes must be performed using an additional API request
(:doc:`../../suite/contacts/contact_update`) if necessary.

.. note:: This endpoint is useful if you intend to:

           * send email campaigns with unsubscribe links which target your own website
          * unsubscribe a contact by updating specific fields in their user profile (e.g. a newsletter flag)
          * count the unsubscription statistics of a specific campaign (not from all campaigns)

In your campaign body, create a new link which points to the unsubscription page of your
website. You can include any of the following additional placeholders: $cid$, $llid$ and $uid$. 

$cid$ will be replaced with the email ID, $llid$ with the launch list ID and $uid$ with the randomly generated contact ID. Example: `http://yourwebsite.com/unsubscribe.html?email_id=$cid$&launchlist_id=$llid$`

For a complete list of campaign related placeholders, see :doc:`../appendices/placeholders`.
