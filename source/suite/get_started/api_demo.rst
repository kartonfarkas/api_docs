API Demo Page
=============

Experiment Before You Code!
---------------------------

We offer an API-demo page for our customers, which has a graphical user interface allowing experimentation with API requests and
their parameters. The responses to the requests are then displayed so they can see what to expect. To access the demo, simply append your Emarsys environment URL with /api-demo/

* Example: if your account is on the suite5.emarsys.net environment, the API demo URL is https://suite5.emarsys.net/api-demo

Check Your Access to the Emarsys API
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Check whether your access data is valid by making a test request to see what languages are available. The steps for this are the following:

* Go to the **Language** tab.
* Leave the text field empty and click on **OK**.

The response will appear on the bottom of the same page. The following table shows the possible responses and the reasons for failure:

.. list-table:: Possible Responses
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 40 40

   * - Response (replyCode, replyText)
     - Possible reason
     - Suggested solution
   * - 0, OK
     - You succeeded, and your credentials were accepted.
     - You should also see the list of the languages.
   * - 1, Unauthorized
     - Something is wrong with your credentials.
     - Check your access information again.
   * - No response at all
     - Something is wrong with your connection./The API URL is invalid./The Emarsys API is not available.
     - Check with your IT support why you cannot reach the API (e.g. if the traffic is blocked by your firewall.)/Check your access information again./Please try again later.

If you have tried the suggested solutions without success, then please contact Emarsys Support.

Check the Response
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The response of your request always appears on the bottom of the page, so after sending a request, don't forget that you might need to scroll down to see the response.

.. note::

   If the Emarsys API is not available or the URL is invalid, the last successful response will be displayed rather than an error message.

Check the Request
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Above the tab bar, you can see the language availability request sent to the Emarsys API. With the aid of this, you can assemble your
request URI by simply concatenating this request with your API URL. For example, if your Emarsys API environment URL is:

* https://suite5.emarsys.net/api/v2/
   and the request which appeared on the API-demo after you sent a contact ID check request is:

* contact/3=Max.Mustermann%40mustermann.at
   then the request URI to use in your code is:

* https://suite5.emarsys.net/api/v2/contact/3=Max.Mustermann%40mustermann.at

.. note::

   The payload of the request (e.g. in the case of a ‘POST’ request) is not displayed on the API Demo page.
