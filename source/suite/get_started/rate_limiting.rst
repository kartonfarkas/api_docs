Rate Limiting
=============

Our goal is high quality of service for all clients. You should expect to be able to make at least 200 requests per
minute. There can be use cases where this limit may be low, please contact us to discuss them and we can adjust our
service according to your needs.

If the rate limit is exceeded, we might block your requests depending on the load of our servers. You should implement
error handling and monitoring for your client.
