Change Policy
=============

We are continuously improving our API. By focusing on introducing backward compatible changes, we are dedicated to
provide an API which lets our customers focus on what's important: improving their service.

From time to time, we have to apply updates which will effect active API usage, but endeavour to share this information with our users in advance. Our latest changes
and news will be made available on the Whatâ€™s New page, and any significant changes will be announced in advance by Customer Support.
