   * - Parameter
     - Description
   * - $user_id$
     - Works in Text Version (../../Create Template-based Email/Content Creation). It is the internal contact ID.
       Including this in the campaign results in having an ID with which the recipient can be identified.
   * - $uid$
     - It also identifies a contact, but it is a randomly generated string. Security level is increased by using
       this as it does not contain actual user data.
   * - $llid$
     - Stands for launch list ID. Launch list contains the IDs of the recipients of launches (identified by launch IDs).
   * - $cid$
     - Campaign includes the campaign ID.
